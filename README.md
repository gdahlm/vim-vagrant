# vagrant.vim

This plugin adds a `:Vagrant` command that runs vagrant. It also sets up
Vagrantfiles to be highlighted as Ruby. Eventually I want to add
tab-completion for the various Vagrant subcommands.

## Installation

With [pathogen.vim](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen) just do:

    cd ~/.vim/bundle
    git clone git://github.com/markcornick/vim-vagrant.git

If you prefer to use something besides pathogen, go ahead.

## Credits

Written by @markcornick. I fumbled my way through VimL by reading
@tpope's code, so thanks to him.
